### **Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals**  

#### **1. [Understanding Neural Networks](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/artificial-intelligence-fundamentals/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-ai-associate-credential)**  
- **Definition**: Neural networks are algorithms inspired by the human brain, consisting of nodes (neurons), layers, weights, and biases.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - **Nodes**: Represent inputs and outputs.  
  - **Weights**: Determine the importance of each input.  
  - **Biases**: Adjust output for better accuracy.  
  - **Hidden Layers**: Capture complex patterns between input and output.  

**Quiz Q&A**  
1. **Why are neural networks used in AI?**  
   To model complex relationships and make accurate predictions by mimicking the brain's learning process.  

2. **What is the role of hidden layers in a neural network?**  
   They discover patterns and relationships in data that aren't directly observable.

#### **2. [Deep Learning Basics](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/artificial-intelligence-fundamentals/turn-data-into-models?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-ai-associate-credential)**  
- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Uses extra layers to extract hidden patterns.  
  - Requires high computational power.  
  - Applicable in image recognition, NLP, and autonomous systems.  

**Quiz Q&A**  
1. **What makes AI training "deep learning"?**  
   **Answer**: C. Layers.  

2. **True or False: Weights and biases in a trained network have obvious connections to inputs.**  
   **Answer**: B. False.

#### **3. [Training Neural Networks](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/artificial-intelligence-fundamentals/understand-the-need-for-neural-networks?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-ai-associate-credential)**  
- **Process**:  
  1. Initialize weights and biases randomly.  
  2. Use forward propagation to calculate output.  
  3. Measure error using a loss function.  
  4. Adjust weights via backpropagation using gradients.  
  5. Repeat until convergence.  
- **Challenges**: Overfitting, underfitting, and computational cost.  

**Quiz Q&A**  
1. **What is backpropagation?**  
   A technique to update weights by minimizing error during training.  

2. **Why is the loss function critical?**  
   It measures how well the network's predictions match the actual output.
